# sgrep: Local Semantic Code Search

sgrep is an open-source semantic search and basic Q&A tool for developers. It is a 100% local, low-friction CLI based application utilizing an optimized RAG architecture.

The core mission is to provide secure, immediate, and context-aware answers to complex queries about proprietary or unfamiliar codebases, directly mitigating the time and security risks associated with cloud-dependent AI agents.

sgrep attemps to address these issues by striking a balance between functionality, and speed, while retaining the natural language interaction we all have more or less grown accustomed to.
