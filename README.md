# sgrep: Local Semantic Code Search

sgrep is an open-source semantic search and basic Q&A tool for developers. It is a 100% local, low-friction CLI based application utilizing an optimized RAG architecture.

The core mission is to provide secure, immediate, and context-aware answers to complex queries about proprietary or unfamiliar codebases, directly mitigating the time and security risks associated with cloud-dependent AI agents.

## Why Use sgrep?

Modern development involves navigating large and sometimes unfamiliar codebases. Current tools generally force a trade-off:

| Tool Type                                           | Benefit                | Drawback                                                                                             |
|:----------------------------------------------------|:-----------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Regex-based Tools (grep, IDE Search)                | Speed and security     | Lack semantic understanding; require manual iteration to find code.                                  |
| Cloud-based Agentic AI Tools(Copilot, Cursor, etc.) | Semantic understanding | Data security risks (data egress) and significant latency (API calls, overthinking simply problems). |

sgrep attemps to address these issues by striking a balance between functionality, and speed, while retaining the natural language interaction we all have more or less grown accustomed to.
